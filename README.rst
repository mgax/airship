This project was an experiment in automated deployment. It explored some
interesting ideas, most of them shamelessly stolen from Heroku
(the 12-factor application, http://12factor.net/), and they worked well.

But the codebase has suffered major changes over time, and it's
needlessly complex in places. Since nobody besides me was really using
it, I think it's better to shelve the project, and maybe start fresh, if
there's enough demand.

If you feel strongly about any of this I'd love to get in touch!
