Welcome to Sarge's documentation!
=================================

Sarge is a server-side tool for deploying applications inspired by the
`twelve-factor methodology`_. It's a wrapper around supervisor_ with
logic to set up and tear down application instances and plugins to
configure services for each instance (e.g. persistence). Take a look at
the :ref:`tutorial` to get a feel for the deployment process.
